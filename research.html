									Recent observations of local, isolated dwarf galaxies find hints for active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in terms of their emission-line ratios, potentially suggesting that star formation in these galaxies was quenched due to feedback from the central AGN. Theoretically, however, numerical simulations have repeatedly shown that AGN feedback mostly regulates star formation in massive galaxies, whereas low-mass galaxies are predominantly affected by stellar feedback. We take advantage of the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG as well as synthetic emission-line models, with a particular focus on isolated dwarf galaxies in the local Universe to investigate possible origin of AGN-like emission-line ratios in isolated quenched dwarfs. In TNG, AGN-like emission-line signatures in quiescent dwarfs are indeed due to ionization from the central AGN, rather than other ionizing sources. However, this by no means implies that quiescent dwarfs are quenched because of AGN feedback in the simulation as environmental conditions also play a very dominant role in initiating the quenching process.

									<h2> Causes of Quiescence in Early, Massive Galaxies</h2>
									<h3><a href="#"><strong><em>On the origin of star-formation quenching in massive galaxies at z≳3

									Hirschmann at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Dr. Francesco Valentino

								<p style="font-size:11pt;"> 
									The goal is to understand what suppresses their star formation so early in cosmic time, and how other similar mass galaxies remain highly star-forming. As a first-order result, the IllustrisTNG simulations are able to produce massive, quiescent galaxies in this high-redshift regime. 
									<mark>We find that active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback is the primary cause of halting star formation in early, massive
									galaxies.</mark> Not only do the central, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of the quenched galaxies have earlier seed times, but
									they also grow faster than in star-forming galaxies. As a result, the quenched galaxies are exposed to AGN feedback for longer,
									and experience the kinetic mode of the AGN feedback earlier than the star-forming galaxies.
									While mergers do not play a significant role in the quenching process, the quenched galaxies tend to reside in more
									massive halos and denser regions during their evolution. As this provides a greater initial amount of infalling gas to the galaxies,
									the large-scale environment can mildly affect the fate of the central SMBH growth and, via AGN feedback, contribute to star
									formation quenching.

									<h2>Presence of Supermassive Black Holes in Jellyfish Galaxies</h2>

								<p style="font-size:11pt;"> Jellyfish galaxies are an extreme example of how galaxies can transform due to residing in dense cluster cosmological environments
									These satellite galaxies are strongly affected by ram-pressure stripping, leading to the formation of their gaseous tails.
									However, a significant number of jellyfish galaxies are also hosts of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Observations and simulations
									give apparently contradictory results as to the link between ram-pressure stripping and AGN feedback, necessitating larger samples
									and more controlled theoretical experiments. <mark>We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological gravitational + magnetohydrodynamical
									simulations to explore the presence of AGN in the origin of jellyfish galaxies from
									the “Zooniverse Cosmological Jellyfish” citizen-science project.</mark> Compared to the population of satellite galaxies, jellyfish have
									more luminous supermassive black holes, and thus higher AGN fractions. Ram-pressure acts to increase densities of the gas in the
									centers of jellyfish galaxies, decreasing their sound speeds and driving supermassive black hole accretion, further distinguishing
									them from other inspected satellites.</p>

									<h2>Spherical Collapse of Dark Matter Halos</h2>

								<p style="font-size:11pt;"> In modern cosmological simulations, dark matter builds the backbone for galaxy formation through 
									 the process of halo collapse. While the current dark matter paradigm, i.e. cold dark matter, is 
									 able to capture the large-scale structure of the Universe, it predicts more small-scale structure
									  (in the form of halos) than is actually observed. This issue may be resolved with the theory of 
									  fuzzy dark matter, which is made of ultra-light particles whose wavelike properties manifest on 
									  sub-galactic scales. The mechanism that suppresses halo collapse in this model is called 
									  quantum pressure, and arises from the Uncertainty principle. However, its behavior has yet to 
									  be fully understood in present theoretical models due to resolution limits. <mark>Using 3-D numerical 
									  simulations of individual halos, we performed a comprehensive analysis of how quantum pressure 
									  affects the collapse of fuzzy dark matter halos.</mark> Then, we made use of a semi-analytic treatment 
									  to predict the halo mass function for this theory. We find that fuzzy dark matter is able to 
									  delay the collapsing process and lead to less compact halo cores.
