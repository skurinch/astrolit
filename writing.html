												<h2>On the Feminine Mystique in Astronomy</h2>
											</header>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/writing/Consolation_of_Philosophy.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<br>
											<p><strong>When the Roman philosopher Boethius was depressed about his place in the Universe, 
												he turned to a cosmic vision.</strong> In this vision, he imagines a conversation with eight 
												women: Philosophie is at the front of the line; Grammaire is reading her book; 
												there’s Rhétorique; Logique is looking stern; Musique is loud and cheerful; and 
												Geometrie is holding her ruler while talking to Arithmétique.
											</p>
											<p>
												The woman who strikes me most, however, is Astronomie. Maybe this has to do with being 
												a young, wishful female astrophysicist myself. But I love the way Astronomie hangs behind 
												all the rest of women, alone and dreamily looking up at the sky with her mouth slightly open. 
												It really gets to me. That <em>is</em> me: I’ll be 
												walking ten steps behind, just thinking to myself and looking around, with my head in outer 
												space.
											</p>
											<p>
												But how else could I relate to this woman in a medieval painting? She’s obviously a scientist, 
												holding her tiny model of the Universe. Like the other women, she has style: with her golden, 
												sand-colored dress, her bright red jacket. She has this veil falling from her “princess’ hat”—the 
												veil falls, and just covers her eyes.
												This small detail, the veil, stops me as I start thinking about Astronomie the woman. Her purpose 
												(and my purpose) is to envision the heavens, to see past the boundaries of our planet, our galaxy. 
												<em>Then why are her eyes covered?</em>

												<h2>Picturing the Universe with Lightbulbs</h2>
											</header>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/writing/Lightbulb_Simulations.png" alt="" /></span>
											<br>
											<p><strong>The Rose Center of Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History is a familiar 
												place to me.</strong> My dad would always bring me there as a kid, so visiting that exhibit—with the
												spiral stairs that follow the 13-billion-year history of the Universe, the light-up panels 
												that illuminate the nature of galaxies, and finally the spectacular Hayden sphere—was almost 
												like returning to a playground. In my ten-year-old mind, all of this was a bright mystery with 
												glass walls and interactive buttons to go with pictures of the night sky. Even now, the Rose Center still holds a lot of mysteries.

																The moon in the bureau mirror <br>

																but she never, never smiles) <br>
																far and away beyond sleep, or <br>
																perhaps she's a daytime sleeper. <br>
																<br>
																<mark>By the Universe deserted, <br>
																<em>she'd</em> tell it to go to hell,</mark> <br>
																and she'd find a body of water, <br>
																or a mirror, on which to dwell. <br>
																So wrap up care in a cobweb <br>
																and drop it down the well <br>
																<br>
																into the world inverted <br>
																where left is always right, <br>
																where the shadows are really the body, <br>
																where we stay awake all night, <br>
																where the heavens are shallow as the sea <br>
																is now deep, and you love me.

																<h3><a href="pages/writing/Davis.html"><strong>The Notebook of Dorothy N. Davis: <em>about loving art and science</em></strong></a></h3>
															</header>
															<a href="/pages/writing/Davis.html" class="image left"><img src="images/writing/Davis_Notebook.jpg" alt="" /></a>
															<p> I had never known Dorothy N. Davis before this. Her notebook sat flat in a bookshelf, 
																next to a stack of pamphlets about the Life and Work of George Ellery Hale. The date on the 
																front read 1939, decades before Rubin was here. It was an old composition notebook. Thick, 
																like a commonplace journal stuffed with curious articles and sidewalk roses. The pages were 
																browned, as if by the heat. It was not just the binding that was full—the wide rules and 
																margins were bursting with her elongated cursive, too.</p>
