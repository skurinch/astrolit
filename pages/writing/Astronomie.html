									<h2>On the Feminine Mystique in Astronomy</h2>
								</header>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="../../images/writing/Consolation_of_Philosophy.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4 style="color: #535353;"><em>Philosophy Presenting the Seven Liberal Arts to Boethius (1460–1470)</em>. The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles.</h4>
								<br>
								<p><strong>When the Roman philosopher Boethius was depressed about his place in the Universe, 
									he turned to a cosmic vision.</strong> In this vision, he imagines a conversation with eight 
									women: Philosophie is at the front of the line; Grammaire is reading her book; 
									there’s Rhétorique; Logique is looking stern; Musique is loud and cheerful; and 
									Geometrie is holding her ruler while talking to Arithmétique.
								</p>
								<p>
									The woman who strikes me most, however, is Astronomie. Maybe this has to do with being 
									a young, wishful female astrophysicist myself. But I love the way Astronomie hangs behind 
									all the rest of women, alone and dreamily looking up at the sky with her mouth slightly open. 
									It really gets to me. That <em>is</em> me: I’ll be 
									walking ten steps behind, just thinking to myself and looking around, with my head in outer 
									space.
								</p>
								<p>
									But how else could I relate to this woman in a medieval painting? She’s obviously a scientist, 
									holding her tiny model of the Universe. Like the other women, she has style: with her golden, 
									sand-colored dress, her bright red jacket. She has this veil falling from her “princess’ hat”—the 
									veil falls, and just covers her eyes.
									This small detail, the veil, stops me as I start thinking about Astronomie the woman. Her purpose 
									(and my purpose) is to envision the heavens, to see past the boundaries of our planet, our galaxy. 
									<em>Then why are her eyes covered?</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									Boethius was a philosopher from the 6th century, and this painting was created in the 15th century.  
									I guess… there’s this premodern concept of the “veiled” woman. She lives in her own sphere, separate 
									from a prevailing masculine order. And apparently it possessed every woman and girl—including, in this 
									painting, Astronomie. But that was 700 years ago, right?
								
									I doubt Boethius or the artist was thinking of any of this when they recorded this vision. 
									But I am going to pick it part: because I think this is really interesting, because I want to 
									understand, for the sake of this piece of art itself.
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>Why is Astronomie the woman veiled?</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									I  mentioned how Astronomie was holding a tiny model of the Universe. She’s standing there, 
									holding this miniature cosmos, as she looks up to the sky for an explanation. Now, I notice 
									that her eyes are looking right at the Sun. If  I were in the 15th century, to me, this would 
									look like: the fiery, masculine symbol of the Sun, while the feminine Moon that lies right 
									above her head… just misses her line-of-sight. The binary gendering of the Sun and Moon goes way back. 
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									Thou makest lesser stars grow dim<br>
									Before the Moon’s reflected rays<br>
									When opposite her kinsman bright:<br>
									<mark>Then closer to the Sun she moves<br>
									And loses all her borrowed light.</mark>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									In a way, Astronomie is placing herself as a woman veiled by her ignorance of the cosmos, 
									under the light and guidance of a remote, all-powerful male. The Moon is not a full moon, but 
									a crescent moon—<em>and it’s shadowed</em>? And so, the feminine part of Astronomie remains in the dark, 
									incomplete without masculine influence.
								</p>
								<p>
									So is the woman astronomer really limited by her feminity?
									I don’t think so, at least I can’t accept it completely. All this talk of “illumination” and 
									“wholeness” verges on a common trait of astronomers that is ultimately empowering, while being 
									self-effacing. Though she is veiled, Astronomie’s soul has this incredible, humble capacity to 
									be expanded by what little glimpses she gets of the cosmos through her veil.
								
									She sees something worth holding in her tiny model of the Universe: which is “nothing” when compared
									to actual complexities of the Universe, but also her whole world, all at once. Like this tiny 
									Universe, she is full of enclosed potential and packed with contemplation—her gaze is thoughtful 
									and full of wonder as she looks up to the sky.
								</p>
								<p>
									The female astronomer’s ability to embrace her insignificance in the huge expanse of the unknown
									is not just in spite of her femininity, but because of it. After spending more time with this 
									painting, I cannot believe the veil only means suppression. Astronomie should be given credit 
									for the way she’s different from Rhétorique, whose eyes are fixed on the ground. Even 
									Philosophie, whose bold gaze looks straight ahead, is just looking at Boethius. Astronomie, on 
									the other hand, is untethered by the Earth or the people around her. Out of the all these women,
									she alone hitches up her skirt in order to better look to the heavens, maybe like a princess, 
									maybe like a brave woman who rejects the norm.
								</p>
								<p>
									I think Astronomie knows that her place and time in the world is small in the grand scheme. 
									Astronomers use this as motivation to explore the cosmos: we do not study the Universe because 
									it is clear to us, but because it is hidden and veiled from us. Astronomie can take that, and 
									turn her veil into a scope for inspiration. So: we wear the veil because we love the mystery and
									also the wonder that come from it.
