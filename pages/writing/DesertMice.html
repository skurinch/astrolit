									<h2>Saturn and Desert Mice</h2>
								</header>
								<br>
								<p><strong>RUN #2 — OBSERVATION NOTEBOOK — June 24, 2018</strong>
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Location: 34&deg; N 106&deg; W 
									<br>
									Elevation: 1400 m
								</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									Saturn seen for the first time—through a telescope—is a pale dot. Raised erect are tens of arms: some pointing to pale Saturn, another tracing the ecliptic plane, one aiming at what looks like an inverted question-mark. <em>That is Scorpius, and there is his tail.</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									Etscorn observatory is something of a castle in the flat, dark aridity of the New Mexican desert. At 11:14 PM, the scattered lights of Socorro are extinguished and the sky is optimal.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Temperature: 85&deg; F
									<br>
									Clouds: Clear
									<br>
									Winds: 26 mph SW
									<br>
									Moon: Waxing Gibbous
								</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									I turn from the audience of local stargazers, past the dome which holds our  telescope. I see the soft red light leak from its doors. I hear the hum of the telescope mount as it slews toward the west, the rattling grind of the dome as my teammate raises its shutter.
								</p>
								<p>
									I enter the control room—also encrimsoned in red light—to find my other teammate blinking at a lurid computer screen. It is a mosaic of star-charts, camera controls, focusing tools, and images of the sky. I seat myself beside him and note some words and numbers which have appeared on the screen.
								</p>
								<p>
									This continues for some time.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;">
									<em>12:23 AM</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									There is something about late-night observing runs: the quiet of Etscorn, the red-light, the hum of the telescope—the dark, velvet serenity of it all. It makes us think.
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>Can the set of all facts exist?</em> Our TA was studying philosophy.
								</p>
								<p>
									We sit back in our chairs.
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>Well—can it?</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>It could, I think. If we live long enough.</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									Yes: if the human race continues to live, and the scientists, artists, mathematicians, and writers continue to survive, sooner or later we should know everything there is to know.
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>Right?
									</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>But—
									</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									Say there exists this “set of all facts”—it exists, and that is a fact. It is a fact that now exists outside of the “set of all facts.”
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>But just add that to the predetermined set. Now you have it.
									</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									And the fact that we have it is a new fact—that now exists outside of the “set of all facts.”
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>Wow. It is a cycle.
									</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									I am only an observer to this conversation, my speech somewhat etherized by the ambience of Etscorn. But I partake in this thought-experiment with all the attention that ingenuity permits.
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>The set of all facts does not—cannot—exist.
									</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									How dispiriting!—to think of such things past midnight, in a dark control room, located in the even vaster darkness of the New Mexican desert. Here we are, researchers: shifting telescope mounts, raising dome shutters, navigating through red-lit dusk. Six weeks, two-thousand miles, away from home: tracing star-charts, squinting at focus tools, regulating camera controls. Each night, sometimes until 3:00 AM: scribbling obscure figures into our observation notebooks. The scientists experiment, the artists sketch, the mathematicians theorize, the writers draft. And even if we—the human race—continue to survive and do so, we will never know all there is to know. <em>The set of all facts cannot exist.</em> Our knowledge will always be incomplete.

								</p>
								<p>
									But in the quiet of Etscorn, the red-light, the hum of the telescope, such thoughts are—well!—beautiful to me.  
								</p>
								<p>
									We are researchers trying to calculate the orbit of an asteroid. Our work will never complete the set of all facts—it will never complete human knowledge. But neither will anyone else’s work. We are insignificant, inconsequential in the cosmos. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>And this uplifts me!</em> There will always be the unknown, the undiscovered to excite me, to inspire me, to enthrall me. I will always be learning: augmenting my awareness of the world, revising it, correcting it.
								</p>
								<p>
									This is why I love observing in Etscorn, why I am a researcher. That is why the people of Socorro were gathered outside the dome, pointing in wonder to Saturn, seen for the first time.
								</p>
								<p>
									I look to a dusty corner of the room, where I hear a desert mouse stirring. Carl Sagan said that astronomy was a humbling experience.
