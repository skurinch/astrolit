								<p>
								Good afternoon, thank you all for coming here on this summer day and welcome to the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Today I’ll not present my own work, as it is usually the case, but I will be reporting findings on the behalf of Mrs. Eunice Newton Foote, on the “Circumstances Affecting the Heat of the Sun’s Rays.” Mrs. Foote writes: “My investigations have had for their object to determine the different circumstances that affect the thermal action of the rays of light that proceed from the Sun. Several results have been obtained…”
								</p>
								<p style="margin-left:40px; color:#535353;">
								<em>EUNICE walks out of the audience, up the stage, and to a podium on the opposite end of the stage. NARRATOR notices, politely stops talking, and the spotlight on him fades out. We only see EUNICE now, and she looks at the audience.</em>
								</p>
								<h3 style="text-align:center;">EUNICE</h3>
								<p>I am Eunice Newton Foote. On August 23, 1856, I sat in the audience as Dr. Joseph Henry, director of the Smithsonian Institution, presented the results from my research. It was the first ever publication in physics written by a woman in America.  I had discovered that increased levels of carbon dioxide could lead to atmospheric heating—basically, I was the first person to predict one of the major mechanisms behind climate change. But I did not get to present my work to the crowd of elite American scientists; a man did.
								<br><br>
								Today, I will tell you a story about my life, about our Earth’s climate, and about women in science and society. It is a story about the past and fate of humanity as a whole.

									<em>Spotlight fades onto EUNICE. In what follows, we flash through scenes at different points in EUNICE’s life.
									</em>
								</p>
								<h3 style="text-align:center;">EUNICE</h3>
								<p>I grew up in New York. My father was a farmer and entrepreneur and, together with my mother, he encouraged my sisters and I to pursue an education. When I was sixteen, my father died. My sister Amanda became the sole owner of all our properties, which was great for her. As for me, I was interested in science. I’m actually a distant relative of Isaac Newton—maybe you have heard of him?—hence my name.
								</p>
								<p style="color:#535353;"> 
									Early 1800s. Troy Female Seminary.
								</p>
								<h3 style="text-align:center;">EUNICE</h3>
								<p>I attended a good school, not the sort that taught girls how to embroider, clean the house, make small talk in French, or be a wife. No, the Troy Female Seminary was actually the first school in the country that provided young women with an education comparable to that of college-educated men. At the time, women could not attend college. But the founder of my school, Emma Willard, believed in teaching girls all subjects, from mathematics to history. She was strict but she encouraged us to participate in science classes, to observe nature, and to experiment.
								</p>
								<p style="color:#535353;"> 
									The 1840s. Seneca Falls.
								</p>
								<h3 style="text-align:center;">EUNICE</h3>
								<p>I eventually married my husband, Elisha Foote. Like me, he had a passion for science and was an inventor. We had two daughters, Mary and Augusta. When we lived near New York, we made friends with the renowned suffragette, Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Together, my husband and I became involved in women’s rights and campaigned for the women’s right to vote.
								</p>
								<p style="color:#535353;"> 
									Early 1800s. Drawing room of EUNICE’s home in New York.
								</p>
								<h3 style="text-align:center;">EUNICE</h3>
								<p>Exploring nature and women’s issues became central to my career through my family and education. I have always wanted to be a scientist but, you know, the scientific community does not exactly welcome the contributions of a woman. Women like me were regarded as amateurs, like children playing at work. Of course I took the cause of women’s rights—I had to. The need to face these challenges contributed to my passion for women’s issues. I came to identify myself as not only a scientist, but also a feminist.

									<em>Spotlight fades onto EUNICE.</em>
								</p>
								<h3 style="text-align:center;">EUNICE</h3>
								<p>
									This brings me to my greatest scientific discovery.
								</p>
								<p style="margin-left:40px; color:#535353;">
									<em>EUNICE walks to the center of the stage, where the spotlight follows her. We see two glass jars on a table, apparently identical. Inside each jar, there is a model Earth sitting in water.</em>
								</p>
								<h3 style="text-align:center;">EUNICE</h3>
								<p>
									It was a sunny day, perfect for my experiment. I wanted to investigate how sunlight affects different gases. I had two jars: one with pure air and the other with carbon dioxide. Placed a thermometer in each jar and read the temperature every minute or, if we wanted to make a cup of tea,  three minutes, and I wrote it down. I noticed that, after a bit of time, the jar with the carbon dioxide was hotter than the jar with pure air.
								</p>
								<p style="margin-left:40px; color:#535353;">
									<em>There are LED lights underneath the jars. As EUNICE is speaking, the LED lights turn on so that the jar with carbon dioxide turns red, while the jar with pure air turns blue.
									</em>
								</p>
								<h3 style="text-align:center;">EUNICE</h3>
								<p>
									<em>(She holds up the red jar.)</em> Imagine the Earth is sitting in a jar—except, the jar is the Earth’s surrounding atmosphere. The more carbon dioxide there is in the jar, or atmosphere, the more the Earth will heat up due to sunlight.  Imagine light traveling smoothly through space. When the rays reach the Earth’s atmosphere, some of the light is reflected back and the rest is trapped or absorbed. If there were no atmosphere most of the sun's heat would be dissipated again in space, the Earth would be as cold as the Moon is.
									<br><br>
									But why is carbon dioxide so special? The atmosphere is made up of a mix of gases that can absorb the reflected radiation. But not all gases absorb in the same way. Their behavior depends on their structures and their electrical charges: oxygen, for example, doesn't  care about the incoming light. Meanwhile, water and carbon dioxide vibrate heavily when irradiated and for this reason they are great absorbers! This causes what we now know as the greenhouse effect, the core mechanism of the climate crisis.

								<p>
									The results of the experiment weren’t just useful for jars, but for the planet. The significance of this conclusion was not lost on me, but they may have been lost to history.
									<br><br>
									The scientific community could have been stronger. My findings hardly crossed the Atlantic, and were not known by my colleagues in Europe. Of course, there was a lot going on. In Italy <em>(indicates audience)</em>, the revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi and his fleet were heading to Sicily to start the Unification of Italy. Back home in the States, we were caught up in “manifest destiny” and expanding out to the West. <em>(Wistfully.)</em> But that is not a sufficient excuse! We were in the heart of the Industrial Revolution. During this era, we began the massive production of carbon dioxide, most of which has remained in the atmosphere.
									<br><br>
									<em>(Angrily.)</em> Why didn’t people listen? Sometimes, I wonder if things would have been different if I had been able to present my own research at the AAAS. Dr. Henry—who gave the presentation in my place—admitted that he could not speak to the significance of my research. Maybe I could have emphasized the importance of atmospheric heating, as I understood it. I was not allowed to, even though I had an education. As a woman in the 1800s, my opportunities were still limited. Women were largely disenfranchised in the scientific community.
									<br><br>
									And so my findings fell to obscurity.

								<!-- SCENE FIVE -->
								<h3><strong>Scene Five</strong></h3>
								<p style="color:#535353;"> 
									April 21, 1902. Bryn Mawr College.
								</p>
								<p style="margin-left:40px; color:#535353;">
									<em>Spotlight fades onto NARRATOR, who is stunned and awed.</em>
								</p>
								<h3 style="text-align:center;">NARRATOR</h3>
								<p>
									“Science was of no country and of no sex. The sphere of woman embraces not only the beautiful and the useful, but the true.” In 1902, the feminist Susan B. Anthony addressed an audience of young women, calling on them to take up the reins of the suffrage movement like its founders, including Eunice Newton Foote.
									<br><br>
									Eunice was right: today, we know that for thousands of years, carbon dioxide and temperature have been found correlated. Glaciers are melting as the increase of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is leading to rising temperatures. Solutions to limit this trend are not easy; they involve reduction of consumptions, changes to our lifestyles, and new technologies. And often, when there are no easy solutions, many do not want to admit there is a problem! Since Eunice Newton Foote, many scientists have spoken out about global warming and were not listened to. How could they listen to Eunice?
									<br><br>
									I remember when I first heard the name Eunice Newton Foote: I was attending a conference on CO2 at the university, here in Trento, and the speaker mentioned her as ‘ a painter, and an amateur in science’. I thought ‘She discovered the greenhouse effect, how can she be considered an amateur ! ’ I wanted to know more about her life!
									<br><br>
									It is no coincidence that Eunice dedicated her life to fighting for women’s rights, while her own voice in climate science was drowned out. Both women and the climate crisis, together, have been overlooked by society throughout history.
									<br><br>
									And it is still a problem now. Women are still significantly underrepresented in science. In our university, women constitute only 23% of students in physics, 22% of those pursuing a PhD, and 16% of researchers and professors. Similar percentages concern other scientific curricula and have serious consequences on our society.  For example, the gender gap in salaries, as higher education gives access to better paid jobs. 
									<br><br>
									Meanwhile, we are still struggling to get the politicians in our government to recognize that atmospheric warming is an important issue. And so we want to tell you this story, and begin to remember all the stories of women in the past. Who were they? What did they think and dream of? It is the responsibility of humanity to really listen: to learn from their stories, uplift forgotten voices, criticize the way things are, and participate in science and progress. Women scientists have sought to shed light on the phenomena of the natural world, and have countlessly found ways to accomplish this.
									<br><br>
									Any complete picture of the anthropocene must also include women’s participation in suffrage and social investment—and of course, science! More than 150 years ago, when Foote published her experiment, we had more time. But today, the climate crisis is an emergency. Perhaps, if people had listened to women, climate science would be decades ahead.
									<br><br>
									Thank you.
